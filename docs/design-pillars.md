# Product Design Pillars

These are the four pillars that guide our product design.

### Design Excellence

Every product is documented extensively.

All Parameters are categorized, have descriptions, defaults and are clamped to sane inputs.

We follow SOLID Design Principles for all of our code.

Every product goes through multiple QA passed before being listed.

### Style-Agnostic by Design

AWL widgets are built to adapt to your game’s visual language, not impose their own.

Hybrid grayscale textures + parameterized materials as the foundation

Retheming is done through materials, styles, and parameters—not asset replacement

Texture stacks (Grunge, Noise, Background, Stencils) reduce custom art needs

### Material-Driven Flexibility

Visual behavior is controlled through materials and parameters, not hardcoded logic and not baked into assets.

All visual properties are animatable via Sequencer

Effects intensity, Textures, Colors are all exposed and tunable.

Procedural effects live in materials, not Blueprint spaghetti

### Composable, Modular Architecture

Widgets are building blocks, not sealed products.

Designed to slot cleanly into existing UIs

Modular structure that supports reparenting, extension, and recomposition

Common UI styles are first-class citizens

Encourages reuse, consistency, and rapid iteration
