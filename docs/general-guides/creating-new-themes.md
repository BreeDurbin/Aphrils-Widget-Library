# Tips for Creating Themes That Vary Drastically from Default Themes

---

## Sci-Fi Theme

* Use thin borders on shapes (1–4 px).
* Keep shapes flat—avoid bevels, satin layers, or other depth effects.
* For slight transparency, use a gray opacity mask:

    * ~70% gray for high opacity
    * ~90% gray for subtle translucency
* Apply noise texture intensity modulation to break up gradient banding.
* Use a plain background texture for digital display–style buttons.

## Flat Theme

* Create shapes similar to the default button shapes.
* Avoid all depth effects such as bevel or satin layers.

## Parchment Theme

* Edges: Make slightly frayed.
* Use a small border or no border at all.
* Apply a parchment-style background.
* Use a stencil for inlaid designs on the parchment.
* For a grunge/frayed edges effect, use a grunge brush to tweak opacity.
