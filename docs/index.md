# Aphril's Widget Library

Welcome to the official documentation for Aphril’s Widget Library.

**Aphril’s Widget Library (AWL)** is a style-agnostic, material-driven UI system built around modular composition, procedural flexibility, and production-ready efficiency—so teams can ship polished interfaces without building a widget library from scratch.

Technical documentation for all products can be found using the navigation on the left.
