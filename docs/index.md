# About

The goal of Aphril's Widget Library is to provide creators with a library of flexible, configurable high quality widgets needed to build user interfaces quickly and efficiently. 

We provide a flexible toolkit of widgets designed to fit into your current game ui design, bringing high quality configurable procedural effects, animations and themeing, 
so that designers can focus on implementing their game rather than building a complete widget library from scratch. 

On top of procedural effects we use a thoughtful texture stack allowing the user to add a variety of texture based effects(Grunge, Background, Noise and Decals) to their widgets. 
This allows widgets to be styled to fit into your games existing ui.

All widgets use a hybrid grayscale texture plus parameterized materials approach allowing materials to easily be dialed in to fit with the desired design of the user.
