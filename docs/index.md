# Aphril's Widget Library

Aphrils Widget Library(Awl) is a line of widgets for UE5.

The goal of Aphril's Widget Library is to provide creators with a modular library of flexible, configurable high quality widgets needed to build user interfaces quickly and efficiently. 

Awl widgets are designed to be flexible enough to fit into your existing game ui design, bringing high quality configurable procedural effects, animations and themeing. 
This lets your team focus on implementing their game rather than building a complete widget library from scratch. 

On top of procedural effects we use a thoughtful texture stack allowing the user to add a variety of texture based effects(Grunge, Background, Noise and Stencils) to their widgets.

All widgets use a hybrid grayscale texture plus parameterized materials approach allowing materials to easily be dialed in to fit with the desired design of the user. 

This approach allows for maximum stylistic flexibility.  You can:
- Retheme any widget by changing the colors in the material
- Change animations by manipulating all material parameters in sequencer
- Change Styling for every widget using all the flexibility of Common Ui styles
- Change the feel of widgets by swapping textures(Grunge, Noise, Background. Stencils) and modulating their intensity
- Create entirely new widget styles by providing your own grayscale shape textures
