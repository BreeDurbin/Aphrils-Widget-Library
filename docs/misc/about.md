**Aphril’s Widget Library (AWL)** is a line of widgets for Unreal Engine 5.

The goal of Aphril’s Widget Library is to provide creators with a modular library of flexible, configurable, high-quality widgets needed to build user interfaces quickly and efficiently.

AWL widgets are designed to integrate cleanly into your existing game UI design, providing high-quality, configurable procedural effects, animations, and theming. This allows your team to focus on building the game itself rather than creating a complete widget library from scratch.

In addition to procedural effects, AWL uses a thoughtful texture stack that allows users to apply a variety of texture-based effects—such as grunge, background, noise, and stencils—to their widgets.

All widgets are built using a hybrid grayscale texture and parameterized material approach, allowing materials to be easily tuned to match the desired visual style of the project.

This approach enables maximum stylistic flexibility. You can:

- Retheme any widget by adjusting material colors
- Modify animations by manipulating material parameters in Sequencer
- Control styling for every widget using the full flexibility of Common UI styles
- Change the overall feel of widgets by swapping textures (grunge, noise, background, stencils) and adjusting their intensity
- Create entirely new widget styles by supplying custom grayscale shape textures
