This lets your team focus on implementing their game rather than building a complete widget library from scratch. </p> <p>On top of procedural effects we use a thoughtful texture stack allowing the user to add a variety of texture based effects(Grunge, Background, Noise and Stencils) to their widgets.</p> <p>All widgets use a hybrid grayscale texture plus parameterized materials approach allowing materials to easily be dialed in to fit with the desired design of the user. </p> <p>This approach allows for maximum stylistic flexibility.  You can: - Retheme any widget by changing the colors in the material - Change animations by manipulating all material parameters in sequencer - Change Styling for every widget using all the flexibility of Common Ui styles - Change the feel of widgets by swapping textures(Grunge, Noise, Background. Stencils) and modulating their intensity - Create entirely new widget styles by providing your own grayscale shape textures</p>"},{"location":"requirements/","title":"Requirements","text":""},{"location":"requirements/#dependencies","title":"Dependencies:","text":""},{"location":"requirements/#uimateriallab","title":"UiMaterialLab","text":""},{"location":"requirements/#commonui","title":"CommonUi","text":""},{"location":"requirements/#engine-version","title":"Engine Version:","text":""},{"location":"requirements/#unreal-engine-56","title":"Unreal Engine 5.6","text":""},{"location":"button-pack/button-pack-creating-new-buttons/","title":"Creating new buttons","text":"<p>under construction</p> <p>guide to creating new button shapes using krita and packing them correctly</p>"},{"location":"button-pack/button-pack-installation/","title":"Install guide:","text":"<ol> <li>Unzip the zip into your plugins folder(Project/Plugins/), you should get: Project/Plugins/AphrilsWidgetLibrary_Buttons</li> <li>Add plugin to uproject directly or add using editor(Edit -&gt; Plugins -&gt; Enable AphrilsWidgetLibrary_Buttons)</li> <li>Install UiMaterialLab.
